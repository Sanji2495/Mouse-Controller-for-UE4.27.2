# Mouse-Controller-for-UE4.27.2

This plugin provides Blueprint Functions to map any Keyboard- or Gamepad Button or -Axis to any Mouse Button or -Axis.

How to Use:

1. Call "Create Mouse Controller". It creates the neccessary variables.
2. Use "Add Input Action Key" and "Add Input Axis Key" for Mapping.
3. Call "Enable Mouse Cursor" to let the action begin. Call "Disable Mouse Controller" to switch it off.
4. There are more Functions to explore. You can find them all in the "Raidfire" Folder. They are self-explaining.
5. Do not forget to plug in the right Player Controller into all Functions!!!
